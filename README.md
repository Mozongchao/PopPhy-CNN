# PopPhy-CNN

PopPhy-CNN,a novel convolutional neural networks (CNN) learning architecture that effectively exploits phylogentic structure in microbial taxa. PopPhy-CNN provides an input format of 2D matrix created by embedding the phylogenetic tree that is populated with the relative abundance of microbial taxa in a metagenomic sample. This conversion empowers CNNs to explore the spatial relationship of the taxonomic annotations on the tree and their quantitative characteristics in metagenomic data.
